### Motivation

> In 2022, approximately 89 million smartphone users in the United States scanned a QR code on their mobile devices, up by 26 percent compared to 2020. Usage of mobile QR code scanners is projected to experience constant growth, reaching over 100 million users in the U.S. by 2025. - [Publication by L.

### Useful resources

- [QRCode.js](https://davidshimjs.github.io/qrcodejs/) - JavaScript Library used to generate QR codes on the fly
- [html2canvas](https://html2canvas.hertzen.com/) - Take a screenshot of your website / in this case the QR card, and converts it into a canvas image which can be converted to PNG.

### Inspiration

- [Frontend Mentor - QR Code Component Challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H) - This project originally started off as a challenge to build a responsive QR card based on the images + style guide provided. After completing the challenge, I adjusted the CSS to my tastes and decided to take it a step further and make the card functional with JavaScript so that it will be useful for those wanting to get their own nice looking QR card in various formats to share, edit and print.
